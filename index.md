I created a website page: Welcome to my blog
---

# This is how I did this

Browse to the index.md file in the my-pages branch.
In the upper right corner, open the file editor.
Type the content you want on your homepage. You can use Markdown formatting on this page.
(optional) You can also modify title: or just ignore it for now. We'll discuss it in the next step.
Commit your changes to the my-pages branch.
